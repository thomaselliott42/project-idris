organise the ui and when all is added for the mapeditor convert it into a atlas
get rid of pngs that are on their own when all atlas are made
organise folders into sections one for mapedior and one for main game mode or menu stuff
some ui shared between such as buttons and stuff

need to go into figma and do custom ui later but for now we ball type shit -- Josh Love you Pookie
